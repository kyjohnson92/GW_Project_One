Project Description
* Our group will be taking a log of NBA shots to determine how effective certain types of shots were and what factors affected those shots. 

Research Questions 
* Who is the worst defender in the league?
* Who is the most clutch shooter in terms of game time?
* Who is the worst shooter in the league?
* Who has the most drastic split between home/away shooting?
* What is the optimal shot in terms of several variables (distance/type of shot/touch time)

Data Set Used
* We will be using the NBA Shot Log found on Kaggle, that took shot data from the 2014/2015 NBA seasons. 

Rough Breakdown of Tasks
* Who is the worst defender in the league?
   * Filter the data for only makes, groupby for 2’s or 3’s, and then aggregate data on defenders and the average distance from shot.   
* Who is the most clutch shooter in terms of game time?
   * Filter the data for 4th quarter, close margins, and game clock, and then take a look at the percentage of makes on shots for individual players.  
* Who is the worst shooter in the league?
   * Filter the data for only misses, groupby for 2’s or 3’s, and then aggregate data on shooters and the average distance from shot.   
* Who has the most drastic split between home/away shooting?
   * Groupby shots by home and away/2’s and 3’s, and then aggregate data for shot percentages
* What is the optimal shot in terms of several variables (distance/type of shot/touch time)
   * Take the made shots and then take the average for each variable.
